  <meta name="description"
    content="Since 1990, Himalaya Carpets has been recognized by the Government as an export house, specializing in various types of carpets, durries, mats, and bathmats. Our primary objective is to provide importers, wholesalers, and retailers worldwide with products of exceptional quality and zero defects.

    As a luxury designer brand, Himalaya Carpets has inherited a legacy of diligence and profound skills over the decades. We strive to maintain these values for years to come. Each carpet we create transports you to a realm of imagination, woven with the stories of skilled artisans who have contributed to crafting these masterpieces. Our ultimate goal is to bring Indiaâ€™s exquisite craftsmanship to the comfort of your home.
    
    Rooted in the town of BHADOHI, renowned as the carpet city in eastern Uttar Pradesh, our artistry dates back to the 16th century. Today, it stands as a significant carpet manufacturing center in India, known for its unmatched intricacy and artistry.
    
    Our commitment to quality is reflected in our use of unique natural materials and traditional handmade techniques, resulting in each carpet possessing its own distinct character. The main material, wool sourced from the Tibetan Highlands, is of the highest quality and durability.
    
    Customization is a hallmark of Himalaya Carpets, as each carpet can be uniquely designed in terms of size, format, and materials. Our modular system even allows for combining collections seamlessly.
    
    The process of carpet weaving requires perfect harmony and synchronized effort among our skilled artisans, reflecting the principles of precision and dedication.
    
    Our emphasis on certified quality and ethical practices is evident through our membership with Unicef, Care & Fair, and Rugmark foundation, ensuring adherence to labor codes and a commitment against child labor.
    
    
    Himalaya Carpets is trusted by esteemed clients, including prominent home stores across Europe, the USA, and Australia. Our responsible and responsive team prioritizes principles such as craftsmanship, quality, and ethical business practices." />
